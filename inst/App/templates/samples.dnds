- Individual drippets are seperate by lines consisting of three or more stars (*)
- Each drippet consists of 3 entries, with each entry having a title and a value (block)
- The title consists of a single line followed by a colon (:)
- titles are *Hint:*, *Snippet Insert:*, *SVGR Image:*
  - The values are blocks defined by 3 backtics *````*
  - Two drippets are shown below to help you get started

Hint: 
```
Sample Arc
```
Snippet Insert:
  ```
	path(
		d=list(
			M=${1:c(.5,.2)*WH}, 
			A=${2:c(2.3*WH, 180,1,0,c(.8,.5)*WH)}
		),
		stroke=${3:'#00FFFF'},
		stroke.width=${4:2},
		fill=${0:'none'}
	) 
```
