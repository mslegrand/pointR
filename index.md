##  Installation Instructions

The recommend installation of **ptR** is to use one of the prebuilt packages shown found to the left. But *prior to installing*, there are a few required dependencies that should be installed.

### Pre-Installation (Requirements)
- **R version 4.0.2** or greater is required. If not already installed, **[install R](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu)** 
- **Pandoc** is required. This means doing either 1. **or** 2. below
	1. **[install pandoc](https://pandoc.org)** (and placing it on your path)  
	2. **[install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)**  (RStudio contains a copy of pandoc)
- The **R** package **[tidyverse ](https://www.tidyverse.org)** is required. This can be installed by doing either 1. **or** 2. below
	1. From a terminal, open **R** and inside the **R** interpretor issue the command 
	*install.packages('tidyverse')*, then when finished issue command *quit()* and close terminal
	2. Open **RStudio** (by clicking on it's icon) and then select the *packages tab* From there click on 
	*install* and in the popup type *tidyverse*. When finished, close **RStudio**.
    
### Installation (Using the Installer)
- Choose the button on the left which matches your OS to download the appropriate installer.
- After downloading, double click on the installer and be patient. **Note**: I have not yet purchased digital signatures, so you may be prompted with a warning. Please ignore.

### Post-Installation (First time running)
- Upon opening, ptR will look for *additiona R-packages* that it requires. If some of these packages are missing, you will be prompted to either quit or let **ptR** install them for you.  When completed, the ptR IDE will start.


Note, **pandoc** is used for **knitr** and is normally included in the **Rstudio** installation. 

## The Relationship Between pointR and ptR
- **pointR** is an R package providing a *shiny-based* minimalist IDE for R scripting using svgR. **pointR** is primarly written in R, with a little bit of javascript for seasoning.
- **ptR** is an **Electron** wrapper around **pointR**. 
- Benefits of using the **Electron** wrapper:
	- Remove potential hiccups by removing and dependency on the local browser 
	- Provide independent windows for help
	- Provide an integrated approach for building **shiny custom inputs**
